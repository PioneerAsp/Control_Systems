# Control-systems
Practices carried out in the course of control systems and PID Project. A PID controller by its acronym for proportional, integral and derivative controller is a very useful control element that through a feedback connection to a closed loop system can regulate both speeds, temperatures, pressure and flow among other variables of a process in general. The objective of the control mechanism is to adjust the variables obtained and bring them closer to the desired variables as precisely and as closely as possible.
